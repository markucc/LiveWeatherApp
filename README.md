Live Weather App
==================

This is the repository for Live Weather App and it is a **work in progress** ðŸš§.
I created this project to get my hands dirty on latest Android tools & libraries (Compose/Testing/Baseline/etc.)


# Development Environment

**Live Weather App** uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into Android Studio (make sure you are using the latest stable version available [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)).

Change the run configuration to `app`.
